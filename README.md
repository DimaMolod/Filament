Program for pair-wise superposition of neighbouring domains in multidomain proteins. For using it you need to have ATSAS package (https://www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/download.html) and PyMol installed on your computer.
The program performs structural alignment of domains and provides one with tranformational matrix, Euler angles and tilt-twist angles for each pair of domains. User have two possibilities how to perform the domains subdivision: using automatic regime based on NMA (PARCOOR program), or manual indication of borders between different modules. The superposition can be performed by SUPCOMB program using NSD metrics (purely structural alignment) or by PyMol (mostrly sequence alignment). Superposition can be manually modified in PyMol before calculation of superposition parameters.Twist and Tilt angles are calculated on base of [Peer Bork et al, 1996].
At the moment the program works only on Unix OS.
